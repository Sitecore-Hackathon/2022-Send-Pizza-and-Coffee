				Automatically Register IController and IRepository implementations in all loaded Assemblies with Dependency Injection
				
				Note that Assemblies with names starting with "Sitecore" are ignored by design.  These configurators are reasonably quick
				and shouldn't have a marked impact in your Sitecore startup time. However, they are convenience features and can easily
				be replaced with hand-made service declarations should you have an unusually large number of assemblies in your solution.
