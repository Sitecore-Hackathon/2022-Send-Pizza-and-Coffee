<!--
	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE DOCUMENT DO NOT MODIFY
	
	PackageVerifier does almost nothing by itself, it's meant as a way for your
	Helix components to install supporting Items into Sitecore without manual intervention.
	
	The XML in this document would typically be included in the config file of your Helix
	component, customized for the specific Package and Items required by your component.
	
	
	You must have the Initialize pipeline processor installed as below or it will not work.
	
	You must have a packageVerifier element to specify how to install your Sitecore Zip Package 
	and how to verify that it is correctly installed after future restarts.

				Kicks off the Package Verifier, which has a separate configuration area to keep the Initialize pipeline clear.
				
				If you're having issues where Sitecore fails to start, ensure that this processor is installed DEAD LAST in the
				initialization pipeline. This particular problem tends to surface when you're using other 3rd party products
				that modify the initialize pipeline, like UCommerce or Glass.

			Package Verifier Configuration
			
			defaultProcessorType: Must descend from the default value - Constellation.Foundation.PackageVerification.PackageProcessor, Constellation.Foundation.PackageVerification
			defaultInstallMode="Merge" mergeMode="Clear"
			defaultMergeMode: [Append|Clear|Merge] default: Clear
			
			
			package nodes: 
					name: Just to make them easy to spot. Should be unique. Also allows you to sc:patch them!
					packageFileName: the name of the .zip file. IMPORTANT: should already exist in data-folder/packages.
					installMode: [Merge|Overwrite|SideBySide|Skip] if not supplied, default is used.
					mergeMode: [Append|Clear|Merge] if not supplied, default is used.
					processorOverrideType: If you don't want to use the default processor.
					
					Artifacts: Items that will exist if the package referenced was previously installed. Should be something a user wouldn't modify.
					You can supply more than one if you have to check multiple databases or disparate parts of the content tree.
					Please note that the fewer artifacts you have to verify the better for performance reasons.
					
					id: the ID of the Item that should exist
					database: the database where the Item lives, typically master or core.
