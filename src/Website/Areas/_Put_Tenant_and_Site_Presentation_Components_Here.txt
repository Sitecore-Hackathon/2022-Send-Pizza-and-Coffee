Each Tenant and Site in your Sitecore install should have its own MVC Area to prevent namespace collisions between projects.
What belongs here? This stuff:

- Controllers
- Models
- Views, including:
- - Renderings
- - Sublayouts
- - Layouts (use the Views/Shared folder

Site-specific
- Repositories
- Model Builders
- Pipeline handlers that relate specifically to page rendering.

What doesn't belong here?
- Globally applicable pipeline handlers
- Extended business logic (create a Feature DLL)
- Reusable business logic (create a Feature DLL)
- Reusable presentation components**

** There are 2 kinds of these, and the rules are different for each:

1. Presentation that applies to all Sites for a givent Tenant belong here, in the Tenant's MVC Area.
2. Presentation that applies to all Sites and all Tenants, this belongs in the root /Controllers, /Models, /Views folders.
