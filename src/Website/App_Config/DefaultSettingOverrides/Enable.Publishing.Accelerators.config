		Important: Review each of the comments in this file and consider if some of the optimizations should be commented out due to the specifics
		of your solution. Enabling this file without taking into account the specifics of your solution can have unexpected consequences.

			<!-- This setting is enabled as an experimental optimization to speed up publishing.
		   The following configuration limits the execution of rules by item event handlers in the core and master databases.
		   You should comment out this element if there are rules in any of the following folders that must be executed on the web database
		   or on any custom databases:
		   /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Item Saved/Rules
		   /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Item Deleted/Rules

				<patch:attribute name="value">core|master</patch:attribute>
			</setting>

			<!-- This setting is changed from the default value to enable parallel processing of publishing candidates.
		   The value '4 ' is specified here as an example.
		   The optimal value for this setting depends on your solution and on the CPU capacity of the server that runs the publishing operations.

		   For example, if the system architecture leverages a dedicated publishing instance with plenty of CPU capacity, this setting can be
		   increased even further.
		   On the other hand, on solutions where publishing is run on an authoring server that is already running a high load, changing this
		   setting to a non-default value may cause system stability issues. 
		   We highly recommend that you perform publishing tests with the expected load before you change this setting in production environments.

		   Please remember that your database server's CPU and disk capacity may need to be adjusted to accommodate this setting.
